# CS-362-Semester-Project
Group Project
We are creating a piggy bank counter. 
The device will rely on a lcd screen, a button for input, and a sensor “confirmed” data. 
The user first inserts a coin into a bank, the sensors will activate confirming if something went in or not. 
Next the user will use the buttons to input how much money they have just inserted. 
Finally, a lcd screen will be used to display the current amount of money inside the bank.
